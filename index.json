This last item is particularly important when supporting girls’ education, given their vulnerability when traveling long distances in remote areas.\nThree secondary school Jim and Nancy Wright scholars wrote their end-of-school exams in August and are currently awaiting their results. We hope to continue to support them through university, starting in September 2023.\nMeanwhile, here is an update on our current (and recently graduated) university students:\nEsau (pictured below) graduated with a degree in Land Survey from Polytechnic University. Jacqueline graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Development Economics from LUNA (Lilongwe University of Agriculture Research). Isabelle is studying Earth Science at MUST (Malawi University of Science and Technology) and is currently in the field enjoying her attachment at the Mzuzu Geological Survey Department. In December she will be back in the classroom for her final year. Naomi is at St-Joseph\u0026rsquo;s College of Nursing where she wrote her final exams in May and is now preparing for the nursing license exams at the end of November. Benson completed his year of apprenticeship in electrical engineering and returns to the classroom in January for his final year at Don Bosco Technical Institute. Our newest university student, Jane Chiona, is enrolled in a 4 year Bachelor of Arts program in media for development. Loyola Jesuit Secondary School This is our fourth year working in partnership with Loyola-Malawi, in memory of Donald Paré, former President of the Paré Foundation, who was deeply committed to the Foundation’s mission, as well as the Jesuit ideal of forming “Women and Men for Others”. We continue to support our first cohort of 5 Paré scholars: four girls, one boy. We are committed to supporting these five students every year through to high school graduation, and beyond.\nLoyola-Malawi is a Jesuit run school located in Kasungu district, a few hours north of Lilongwe, the capital. The school boasts beautiful grounds and a new building to welcome its students. Admission is based on merit alone. Run by the Zambia-Malawi Jesuit Province, Loyola strives to offer a ‘preferential option for the poor’* – in this case, high quality education to those that otherwise wouldn’t have access to such schooling. We at the Paré Foundation are thrilled to participate in that mission.\n*The term ‘preferential option for the poor’ is attributed to the Jesuits of Latin America, in the 1960s.\n","date":1669334400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669334400,"objectID":"1d79af6a59efc8e30c5f15a90b3869ae","permalink":"https://parefoundation.github.io/projects/current-projects/malawi/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/current-projects/malawi/","section":"projects","summary":"The Jim and Nancy Wright Scholars Led and managed by Antoinette Holland, the Foundation’s agent in Malawi, the program is focused on providing youth, and especially girls, the opportunity to continue their education despite their lack of resources.\nThe Jim and Nancy Wright Scholars Program (named in recognition of the Wright family’s long-term support of Antoinette (Toni) Holland’s work, and to honour Jim’s memory) continues to be the model on which new Paré Foundation projects are based.","tags":null,"title":"Malawi","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In the Dominican Republic, we supported Charlene for her early elementary education.

The multi-year adult immersion program is offered by the Mohawk Language Custodian Association of Kanehsatà:ke and is designed to ensure the ancestral language survives and flourishes.\nFour students graduated at the end of the last session out of a group of six. Interest in the program is growing because the graduates are speaking Mohawk (Kanien\u0026rsquo;kéha) in public, and on the local radio station. That has inspired and motivated others: this year there were twenty-five new applicants, and twenty have been accepted.\nMost of the adult students have no income stream or financial support to cover living expenses during their training. While federal funding from Heritage Canada pays for the courses, the Paré Foundation contribution is used to help with the living costs of students who fall short, and it is shared at the discretion of their board. This support motivates the students, who also do local fundraising to cover their expenses, often having given up regular work to meet the demands of the program.\nThe Mohawk Language Custodian Association has also managed to get help from McGill University, which provides access to a teacher training program; fifteen of the twenty new students are participating in both programs. This will help students acquire teaching skills. They will be able to eventually replace the dedicated Elders who have been carrying the project and who are currently teachers at Kanehsatà:ke Elementary and High School.\nCareJeunesse Centre Amitié, Ressources, et Entraide pour la Jeunesse (C.A.R.E.

Given the demand-driven nature of the work of the Foundation, activities tend to vary depending on the needs of the individual student and the country context. The specificities of each investment are determined by the Foundation’s Board of Directors in consultation with the agents managing each project.\nLooking back If you’d like more information on the Paré family, take a look at The Seeds, a family history written by Lucy Griffith Paré in collaboration with her son Antoine Paré (published in 1984).
