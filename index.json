This last item is particularly important when supporting girls’ education, given their vulnerability when traveling long distances in remote areas. In addition, students are guaranteed continued support throughout their secondary education, conditional upon satisfactory academic achievement. We are currently supporting 8 students in secondary school.\nAmong the Wright Scholars that have graduated from secondary school, 7 have gone on to university and been able to count on continued support from the Foundation. We are currently supporting 5 university students: Esau is at Polytechnic University finishing a Bachelor of Science in Land Survey; Jacqueline is at LUNA (Lilongwe University of Agriculture Research) in her last year of a Bachelor of Science in Development Economics; Isabel is studying Earth Science at MUST (Malawi University of Science and Technology); Naomi is at St-Joseph\u0026rsquo;s College of Nursing; and Benson is enrolled in a program to become an electrician.\n     Loyola Jesuit Secondary School We’re very pleased to announce our new partnership with Loyola-Malawi, launched in memory of Donald Paré, former President of the Paré Foundation, who was deeply committed to the Foundation’s mission, as well as the Jesuit ideal of forming “Women and Men for Others”. Starting in 2020-21, we welcome our first cohort of 5 Paré scholars: four girls, one boy. We are committed to supporting these five students every year through to high school graduation, and beyond.\nLoyola-Malawi is situated in Kasungu district, a few hours north of Lilongwe, the capital. The school boasts beautiful grounds and a new building to welcome its students. Admission is based on merit alone. Run by the Zambia-Malawi Jesuit Province, Loyola strives to offer a ‘preferential option for the poor’* – in this case, high quality education to those that otherwise wouldn’t have access to such schooling. We at the Paré Foundation are thrilled to participate in that mission.\n*The term ‘preferential option for the poor’ is attributed to the Jesuits of Latin America, in the 1960s.\n","date":1606521600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606521600,"objectID":"1d79af6a59efc8e30c5f15a90b3869ae","permalink":"https://parefoundation.github.io/projects/current-projects/malawi/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/current-projects/malawi/","section":"projects","summary":"The Jim and Nancy Wright Scholars Led and managed by Antoinette Holland, the Foundation’s agent in Malawi, the program is focused on providing youth, and especially girls, the opportunity to continue their education in secondary school despite their lack of resources.\nThe Jim and Nancy Wright Scholars Program (named in recognition of the Wright family’s long-term support of Antoinette (Toni) Holland’s work, and to honour Jim’s memory) continues to be the cornerstone of the Foundation’s activities.","tags":null,"title":"Malawi","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In partnership with the Haitian Education and Leadership Program (HELP), the Foundation has set up a Paré Scholar Program to support deserving young students in Haiti.\nStarted in 2010, shortly after the earthquake, the Paré scholar program consists of:\n Tuition-free classes at an internationally accredited university Textbooks and supplies Housing in HELP dorms and a living stipend Academic advising and counseling, including computer literacy and English classes Leadership \u0026amp; Citizenship training  For more information on HELP\u0026rsquo;s program, click here.\nOur current Paré Scholar, Valencia Dorvilus, is studying agro-economics at Quisqueya University in Port-au-Prince.

In the beginning, it was also active in the area of literary publication and supported the distribution of The Seeds, a family history.\n 2005-Present Since 2005, the Paré Foundation’s activities have focused on supporting students in a variety of countries. Currently, the Foundation works with partners and agents in Malawi, Haiti, India, and Canada. The Paré Foundation has also supported short-term projects in Bolivia, Dominican Republic, Israel, and Uganda.\n Looking ahead The Foundation’s projects center on investing in the education of children and youth, in particular. Given the demand-driven nature of the work of the Foundation, activities tend to vary depending on the needs of the individual student and the country context. The specificities of each investment are determined by the Foundation’s Board of Directors in consultation with the agents managing each project.\n Looking back If you’d like more information on the Paré family, take a look at The Seeds, a family history written by Lucy Griffith Paré in collaboration with her son Antoine Paré (published in 1984).
