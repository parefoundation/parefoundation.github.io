This last item is particularly important when supporting girls’ education, given their vulnerability when traveling long distances in remote areas. In addition, students are guaranteed continued support throughout their secondary education, conditional upon satisfactory academic achievement. We are currently supporting 8 students in secondary school.\nAmong the Wright Scholars that have graduated from secondary school, 7 have gone on to university and been able to count on continued support from the Foundation. We are currently supporting 5 university students: Esau is at Polytechnic University finishing a Bachelor of Science in Land Survey; Jacqueline is at LUNA (Lilongwe University of Agriculture Research) in her last year of a Bachelor of Science in Development Economics; Isabel is studying Earth Science at MUST (Malawi University of Science and Technology); Naomi is at St-Joseph\u0026rsquo;s College of Nursing; and Benson is enrolled in a program to become an electrician.\n    ","date":1574726400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574726400,"objectID":"1d79af6a59efc8e30c5f15a90b3869ae","permalink":"https://parefoundation.github.io/projects/current-projects/malawi/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/current-projects/malawi/","section":"projects","summary":"The Jim and Nancy Wright Scholars Led and managed by Antoinette Holland, the Foundation’s agent in Malawi, the program is focused on providing youth, and especially girls, the opportunity to continue their education in secondary school despite their lack of resources.\nThe Jim and Nancy Wright Scholars Program (named in recognition of the Wright family’s long-term support of Antoinette (Toni) Holland’s work, and to honour Jim’s memory) continues to be the cornerstone of the Foundation’s activities.","tags":null,"title":"Malawi","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In the Dominican Republic, we supported Charlene for her early elementary education.

In the beginning, it was also active in the area of literary publication and supported the distribution of The Seeds, a family history.\n2005-Present Since 2005, the Paré Foundation’s activities have focused on supporting students in a variety of countries. Currently, the Foundation works with partners and agents in Malawi, Haiti, India, and Canada. The Paré Foundation has also supported short-term projects in Bolivia, Dominican Republic, Israel, and Uganda.\nLooking ahead The Foundation’s projects center on investing in the education of children and youth, in particular. Given the demand-driven nature of the work of the Foundation, activities tend to vary depending on the needs of the individual student and the country context. The specificities of each investment are determined by the Foundation’s Board of Directors in consultation with the agents managing each project.\nLooking back If you’d like more information on the Paré family, take a look at The Seeds, a family history written by Lucy Griffith Paré in collaboration with her son Antoine Paré.
