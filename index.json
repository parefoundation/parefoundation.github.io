This last item is particularly important when supporting girls’ education, given their vulnerability when traveling long distances in remote areas.\nThe high school students we supported are now all enrolled in university:\nTamandani and Judith recently graduated from high school and have been accepted to the Kamuzu University of Health Sciences for 5-year Bachelors degrees in Science of Nutrition and Dietetics and Biomedical Science, respectively. Benson (pictured above) is completing his final year at Don Bosco Youth Technical Institute in Electrical Engineering. His placement ends in December and his graduation ceremony will take place in February 2024.

Loyola Jesuit Secondary School This is our fifth year working in partnership with Loyola-Malawi, in memory of Donald Paré, former President of the Paré Foundation, who was deeply committed to the Foundation’s mission, as well as the Jesuit ideal of forming “Women and Men for Others”.\nWe are pleased to report that our first cohort of five students successfully passed their high school graduating exams. As of this school year, we have a new group of five students \u0026ndash; all girls \u0026ndash; that are beginning their high school journey. Admission is by merit, and our support gives these girls from disadvantaged backgrounds access to career possibilities that would otherwise have been impossible.\nLoyola-Malawi is a Jesuit run school located in Kasungu district, a few hours north of Lilongwe, the capital. The school boasts beautiful grounds and a new building to welcome its students. Admission is based on merit alone. Run by the Zambia-Malawi Jesuit Province, Loyola strives to offer a ‘preferential option for the poor’* – in this case, high quality education to those that otherwise wouldn’t have access to such schooling. We at the Paré Foundation are thrilled to participate in that mission.\n*The term ‘preferential option for the poor’ is attributed to the Jesuits of Latin America, in the 1960s.\n","date":1701043200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1701043200,"objectID":"1d79af6a59efc8e30c5f15a90b3869ae","permalink":"https://parefoundation.github.io/projects/current-projects/malawi/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/current-projects/malawi/","section":"projects","summary":"The Jim and Nancy Wright Scholars Led and managed by Antoinette Holland, the Foundation’s agent in Malawi, the program is focused on providing youth, and especially girls, the opportunity to continue their education despite their lack of resources.\nThe Jim and Nancy Wright Scholars Program (named in recognition of the Wright family’s long-term support of Antoinette (Toni) Holland’s work, and to honour Jim’s memory) continues to be the model on which new Paré Foundation projects are based.","tags":null,"title":"Malawi","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In the Dominican Republic, we supported Charlene for her early elementary education.

The multi-year adult immersion program is offered by the Mohawk Language Custodian Association of Kanehsatà:ke and is designed to ensure the ancestral language survives and flourishes.\nInterest in the program is growing because the graduates are speaking Mohawk (Kanien\u0026rsquo;kéha) in public and on the local radio station, and they are starting to occupy many significant roles in the community. That has inspired and motivated others: this year there are 17 students enrolled in Ratiwennenhá:wi Adult Language and Cultural Immersion program.\nMost of the adult students have no income stream or financial support to cover living expenses during their training. While federal funding from Heritage Canada pays for the courses, the Paré Foundation contribution is used to help with the living costs of students who fall short, and it is shared at the discretion of their board. This support motivates the students, who also do local fundraising to cover their expenses, often having given up regular work to meet the demands of the program.\nThe Mohawk Language Custodian Association has also managed to get help from McGill University, which provides access to a teacher training program. This will help students acquire teaching skills. They will be able to eventually replace the dedicated Elders who have been carrying the project and who are currently teachers at Kanehsatà:ke Elementary and High School.\nCareJeunesse Centre Amitié, Ressources, et Entraide pour la Jeunesse (C.A.R.E.

Given the demand-driven nature of the work of the Foundation, activities tend to vary depending on the needs of the individual student and the country context.
